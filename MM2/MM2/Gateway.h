    /// <summary>
    /// Manages a messaging-mesh gateway.
    /// 
    /// UV loop and threading
    /// ---------------------
    /// The gateway uses a UV loop to manage a socket listeing for client connections.
    /// All methods except the constructor and destructor will be called from the UV
    /// loop's thread.
    /// 
    /// Services
    /// --------
    /// When clients connect using the Connection class, they specify a service. Each service
    /// is a messaging group where clients can send and receive messages with each other. All
    /// messages sent or received by the Connection are managed within the service. 
    /// 
    /// Message subjects are scoped by the service. So a client subscribing to subject A.B on
    /// service SERVICE-1 will only recieve updates to A.B sent by other clients connected to
    /// SERVICE-1. This allows a single gateway to manage messaging for multiple systems with
    /// no cross-talk of messaging between them, even if they use the same subject names.
    /// 
    /// One UV loop per service
    /// -----------------------
    /// The gateway has a loop which it uses to listen for new client connections. All initial
    /// connections are handled by this loop, regardless of service. At the point of the initial
    /// connection we do not yet know the service requested by the client and the client socket
    /// will be held in the pending-connection collection.
    /// 
    /// Shortly after making a connection the client will send a CONNECT message including the
    /// service name. The gateway will then find the ServiceManager for this service, or create
    /// one if this is the first client for the service. The client socket will be handed to the
    /// ServiceManager and removed from the pending-connection collectio.
    /// 
    /// Each ServiceManager runs its own UV loop, so all subsequent interactions with the client
    /// will be managed by that loop. This means that each service runs on its own thread.
