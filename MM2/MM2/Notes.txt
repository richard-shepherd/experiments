Move socket to a different UV loop
----------------------------------
- *** Think about cross thread visibility ***

- When we move a socket, we should keep the name name for it

- Client observer onNewConnection() is called from the listening loop when a socket has been created

- This could call moveToLoop(UVLoop)
  - Create a duplicate socket
  - Mark the socket as not connected (so that writes are queued)
  - Close the original UV socket handle
  - Wait for close to complete
  - Change the Socket's UVLoop to the new one
  - Register the duplicated socket on the new loop
    - Including starting read and write

- *** The Socket has to stay alive while we do this ***
  - So we need to keep a reference to the SocketPtr
  - Maybe have a callback when the move is complete?
  - Can the callback include data to indicate which Service it is associated with?
