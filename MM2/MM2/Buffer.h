    /// <summary>
    /// A binary buffer managing a byte-array, holding for example the network 
    /// serialization of a NetworkMessage.
    ///
    /// Two ways the Buffer is used
    /// ---------------------------
    /// - Serialize data into the buffer and then send it over the network.
    /// - Receive a network message into a Buffer and then deserialize data from it.
    /// 
    /// These are discussed in more detail below.
    /// 
    /// Serialize data into the buffer
    /// ------------------------------
    /// The buffer starts at an initial size which will be expanded if data 
    /// is written to the buffer that would go beyond that size.
    ///
    /// Data is written to the buffer at the current position. By default this
    /// will be updated to the next available position as data is written to the 
    /// buffer. You can change the position manually if you need to write into 
    /// the buffer at a point other than the end.
    ///
    /// You can request the data size from the buffer which will return the number 
    /// of bytes in the buffer, regardless of where the position is set.
    /// 
    /// Note on data-size vs buffer-size:
    /// - The data-size is the size of all data serialized to the Buffer.
    /// - The buffer-size is the size of the byte-array itself, which may not be
    ///   fully filled by the serialized data.
    ///
    /// After data has been serialized into the Buffer you can pass it to the
    /// Socket::write() method to send the data via the socket.
    /// 
    /// Receive a network message
    /// -------------------------
    /// When a Socket receives data over the network it creates a new Buffer object
    /// and populates it with the data it receives. 
    /// 
    /// The first bytes in a network message are the size of the message / Buffer so
    /// once these have been received the Socket and Buffer can work together to 
    /// populate the Buffer. For large messages this may be done over multiple network
    /// updates received by the Socket. 
    /// 
    /// The byte-array includes the size
    /// --------------------------------
    /// The byte-array managed by the Buffer includes the size of the byte-array as 
    /// a little-endian int32 serialized into the first four bytes of the array.
    /// 
    /// Note: This size includes the size of the size itself.
    /// 
    /// For example, a buffer holding a double and an int will look like:
    /// - size   (4 bytes), value=16
    /// - double (8 bytes)
    /// - int    (4 bytes)
    /// 
    /// The total size of the buffer - including the size itself - is 16 bytes, and 
    /// this is stored as the size in the first four bytes of the array.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// 
    /// The buffer includes the size
    /// ----------------------------
    /// The first four bytes of the buffer is the data size stored in a little-endian
    /// format. This helps when sending buffers over the network as receiving code can
    /// see how much data to expect.
    /// 
    /// NOTE: This is the size of the data itself, not including the size.
    ///       So it is m_dataSize - INITIAL_POSITION.
    /// 
    /// The size is added to the buffer when the getBuffer() method is called.
