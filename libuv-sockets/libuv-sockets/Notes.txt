TODO

- Handle disconnections
- Logger should be thread safe

Move socket to a different UV loop
----------------------------------
- Client observer onNewConnection() is called from the listening loop when a socket has been created

- This could call moveToLoop(UVLoop)

- When we move a socket, we should keep the name name for it
