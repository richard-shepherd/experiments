- Handle client disconnection from peers
- Work out how to send metadata with connections to the server
- Work out how to get peer info (by location) from the server





Client disconnection
--------------------
- Client may disconnect from one or many peers
  - Do we get an event?

- Does it matter if we lose connection to the peer-server
  once the client connections have been made?
  - I think it should not.
  - TEST this. (By stopping the server on the command-line.)
  - BUT: We need to be connected to the server, so that
         peers can find us if they disconnect.

- Find the disconnection events.

- Find the error events.

- When playing a game, each player knows who the other players are
  - Should try to reconnect to them.
  - We need to know when a game is over.

- How do we make sure that all players in a game are playing with all
  the same peers?
  - To do with the Master player?
 


Client ID
---------
- Each player gets a GUID.
  - Stored with the game.
  - This is the ID used for peer connections

- Player also has a name
  - Which does not have to be unique.
  - (As players are discovered by location.)



Master player / Hub player
--------------------------
- One player decides to be the Hub / Host
  - (This should be the player with the best data connection 
    and/or fastest phone.)

- Maybe have a game screen where you can:
  - "Start" a game (as the Hub)
  - "Join" a game (hosted by a Hub)
  - See which games are available close to you.





Sending metadata with the peer-server connection
------------------------------------------------
- Can we send meta-data with the server connection?
  - I think I saw something like this (???)

- It would be very useful to send:
  - ID (GUID)
  - Readable name
  - Position (lat/long)



Query for peers
---------------
