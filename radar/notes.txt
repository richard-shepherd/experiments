- Radar should have a sweeping line, like an old-fashioned air traffic radar
  - Objects should highlight when touched, and then fade.

- Optimize by creating the radar as an image and rotating it???

- Try overlaying the radar on the video
  - As a sort of HUD


 - We have a collection of Players. Each one has:
   - latitude
   - longitude
   - color

- OR: A collection of objects
  - These could be players or items (ammo, guns etc)



- We show players who are within ome distance of our position
  - Say 200m (though configurable)

- For each player we convert their position to:
  - Distance from our position
  - Angle from us
    - So get distance as x-distance, y-distance and total distance

- We convert the angles relative to the direction we are facing.
  - Say they are E (90-deg)
  - We are NE (50-deg)
  - They are 40-deg to our right
    - ie, them-us

- Them = 10, us = 90
  - them-us = -80 = -80%360 = 280

- OR: Can we plot everyone in absolute values, and then rotate the canvas?
  - Maybe that's easier / faster?
  - I think it will be
